# MameOutputSender
Converted nixxou's MameOutputSender from windows communication to network communication. This is to make it work with Hook Of The Reaper and LGTCPTester.

# Install
Simply replace the MameOutputSender.exe in nixxou's 4 light gun emulators. The program is in the main directory of the emulators. Alternatively, you can rename the MameOutputSender.exe to something else, and then copy the new one into the directory. Please note, that the name cannot be changed, and has to be 'MameOutputSender.exe', as this is what the emulator looks for.

## Dolphin Emulator (Wii)
To enable the MameOutputSender in the Dolphine, go to the 'Settings', by mouse clicking the 'Config' icon. It will bring up a new 'Settings' window, on the 'General' tab. Then check the 5th check box, in the 'Basic Settings', labeled 'Enable MameHooker Outputs'. That is it, and ready for the Dolphin Emulator.
