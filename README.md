# MameOutputSender
Converted nixxou's MameOutputSender from windows communication to network communication. This is to make it work with Hook Of The Reaper and LGTCPTester. Only one can connect to MameOutputSender, so don't use both at the same time. 

Latest Version is v1.1, which added in more code to disconnect the TCP Server. 

## Install
Simply replace the 'MameOutputSender.exe' in nixxou's 3 light gun emulators. The program is in the main directory of the emulators. Alternatively, you can rename the 'MameOutputSender.exe' to something else, and then copy the new one into the directory. Please note, that the name cannot be changed, and has to be 'MameOutputSender.exe', as this is what the emulator looks for.
